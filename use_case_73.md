# Use Case 73: Using Cloudflare Workers for A/B Testing

Cloudflare Workers can be used to implement A/B testing, which is a method of comparing two versions of a webpage or app against each other to determine which one performs better.

Here is an example of how you can use a Cloudflare Worker for A/B testing:

```javascript
addEventListener('fetch', event => {
  event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request))
})

/**
 * Respond with one of two variants, as determined by the cookie header
 * @param {Request} request
 */
async function handleRequest(request) {
  const NAME = 'experiment-1'
  // The Responses below are placeholders. You'd want to fetch
  // responses from a real URL
  const TEST_RESPONSE = new Response('Test group')
  const CONTROL_RESPONSE = new Response('Control group')
  const cookie = request.headers.get('cookie')
  if (cookie && cookie.includes(`${NAME}=control`)) {
    return CONTROL_RESPONSE
  } else if (cookie && cookie.includes(`${NAME}=test`)) {
    return TEST_RESPONSE
  } else {
    // Determine which group this requester is in.
    const group = Math.random() < 0.5 ? 'test' : 'control'
    // Set the cookie in the response
    const response = group === 'control' ? CONTROL_RESPONSE : TEST_RESPONSE
    response.headers.append('Set-Cookie', `${NAME}=${group}; path=/`)
    return response
  }
}
```

In this example, we are using the Fetch API to listen for the fetch event. When a fetch event occurs, we respond with the handleRequest function. This function checks if the request headers include a cookie for our experiment. If the cookie exists, we return the corresponding response. If the cookie does not exist, we determine which group the requester is in and set the cookie in the response.
