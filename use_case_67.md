# Use Case 67: Using Cloudflare Workers for A/B Testing

Cloudflare Workers can be used to implement A/B testing, which is a method of comparing two versions of a webpage or application against each other to determine which one performs better.

Here is a simple example of how you can use a Cloudflare Worker for A/B testing:

```javascript
addEventListener('fetch', event => {
  event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request))
})

/**
 * Respond with one of two versions of a site, as part of A/B testing.
 * @param {Request} request
 */
async function handleRequest(request) {
  const NAME = 'experiment-1'

  // The Responses below are placeholders. You can set up your own custom
  // responses in their place.
  const VARIANT_A = new Response('Variant A', {
    headers: { 'content-type': 'text/plain' }
  })
  const VARIANT_B = new Response('Variant B', {
    headers: { 'content-type': 'text/plain' }
  })

  // Determine which group this requester is in.
  const cookie = request.headers.get('cookie')
  if (cookie && cookie.includes(`${NAME}=control`)) {
    return VARIANT_A
  } else if (cookie && cookie.includes(`${NAME}=test`)) {
    return VARIANT_B
  } else {
    // If there is no cookie, this is a new client. Choose a group and set the cookie.
    let group = Math.random() < 0.5 ? 'control' : 'test'
    let response = group === 'control' ? VARIANT_A : VARIANT_B
    response.headers.append('Set-Cookie', `${NAME}=${group}; path=/`)
    return response
  }
}
```

In this example, we are using the `fetch` event listener to handle incoming requests. We define two responses, `VARIANT_A` and `VARIANT_B`, which represent the two versions of our site. We then check the request's cookies to see if this client has been assigned to a group. If they have, we return the corresponding variant. If they haven't, we randomly assign them to a group, set a cookie to remember this, and return the corresponding variant.
