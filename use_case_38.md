# Use Case 38: Using Cloudflare Workers for A/B Testing

Cloudflare Workers can be used to implement A/B testing, which is a method of comparing two versions of a webpage or app against each other to determine which one performs better.

Here is an example of how you can use a Cloudflare Worker for A/B testing:

```javascript
addEventListener('fetch', event => {
  event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request))
})

/**
 * Respond with one of two variants, stored in `VARIANTS`,
 * and set a cookie to persist a visitor's variant
 * @param {Request} request
 */
async function handleRequest(request) {
  const NAME = 'experiment-0'
  const VARIANT_A = 'https://variant-a.example.com'
  const VARIANT_B = 'https://variant-b.example.com'
  const cookie = request.headers.get('cookie')
  if (cookie && cookie.includes(`${NAME}=a`)) {
    return fetch(VARIANT_A)
  } else if (cookie && cookie.includes(`${NAME}=b`)) {
    return fetch(VARIANT_B)
  } else {
    // User hasn't visited before or their cookie was not set
    // Perform the A/B test
    const group = Math.random() < 0.5 ? 'a' : 'b'
    const response = await fetch(group === 'a' ? VARIANT_A : VARIANT_B)
    // Set a new cookie for future visits
    response.headers.append('Set-Cookie', `${NAME}=${group}; path=/`)
    return response
  }
}
```

In this example, the worker checks if the incoming request has a cookie that indicates which variant to serve. If the cookie is not present, it randomly selects a variant and sets a cookie for future visits.
