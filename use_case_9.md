# Use Case 9: Using Cloudflare Workers for A/B Testing

Cloudflare Workers can be used to implement A/B testing, which is a method of comparing two versions of a webpage or app against each other to determine which one performs better.

Here's a simple example of how you can use a Cloudflare Worker for A/B testing:

```javascript
addEventListener('fetch', event => {
  event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request))
})

/**
 * Respond with one of two variants, controlled by a cookie
 * @param {Request} request
 */
async function handleRequest(request) {
  const NAME = 'experiment-0'
  const VARIANT_A = 'https://variant-a.example.com'
  const VARIANT_B = 'https://variant-b.example.com'
  const cookie = request.headers.get('cookie')
  if (cookie && cookie.includes(`${NAME}=variant-a`)) {
    return fetch(VARIANT_A)
  } else if (cookie && cookie.includes(`${NAME}=variant-b`)) {
    return fetch(VARIANT_B)
  } else {
    // No cookie, so this is a new client. Experiment and set a cookie.
    const group = Math.random() < 0.5 ? 'variant-a' : 'variant-b' // 50/50 split
    const response = await fetch(group === 'variant-a' ? VARIANT_A : VARIANT_B)
    // Set a cookie so that they stay in this group
    response.headers.append('Set-Cookie', `${NAME}=${group}; path=/`)
    return response
  }
}
```

In this example, we're using a cookie to keep track of which variant a user should see. When a request comes in, we check for the presence of a cookie that tells us which group the client is in. If there's no cookie, we decide randomly and set the cookie on the response.
