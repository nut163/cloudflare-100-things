# Use Case 64: Using Cloudflare Workers for A/B Testing

Cloudflare Workers can be used to implement A/B testing, which is a method of comparing two versions of a webpage or app against each other to determine which one performs better.

Here is a simple example of how you can use a Cloudflare Worker for A/B testing:

```javascript
addEventListener('fetch', event => {
  event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request))
})

/**
 * Respond with one of two versions of a webpage
 * @param {Request} request
 */
async function handleRequest(request) {
  const NAME = 'experiment-1'
  // The Responses below are placeholders. You can set up your own custom
  // responses in their place.
  const VARIANT_A = new Response('Variant A', { headers: { 'content-type': 'text/html' } })
  const VARIANT_B = new Response('Variant B', { headers: { 'content-type': 'text/html' } })

  const cookie = request.headers.get('cookie')
  if (cookie && cookie.includes(`${NAME}=control`)) {
    return VARIANT_A
  } else if (cookie && cookie.includes(`${NAME}=test`)) {
    return VARIANT_B
  } else {
    // Determine which group this requester is in.
    const group = Math.random() < 0.5 ? 'control' : 'test'
    // Set the cookie in the response
    const response = group === 'control' ? VARIANT_A : VARIANT_B
    response.headers.append('Set-Cookie', `${NAME}=${group}; path=/`)

    return response
  }
}
```

In this example, we are using the `fetch` event listener to handle incoming requests. We define two responses, `VARIANT_A` and `VARIANT_B`, which represent the two versions of our webpage. We then check the request's cookies to see if the user has already been assigned to a group. If they have, we return the corresponding variant. If they haven't, we randomly assign them to a group, set a cookie to remember their group, and return the corresponding variant.

This is a simple example, but it shows the power of Cloudflare Workers for implementing A/B testing. You can extend this example to serve entirely different webpages, perform more complex group assignments, and more.
