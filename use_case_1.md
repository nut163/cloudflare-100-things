# Use Case 1: Using Cloudflare Workers for Edge Caching

Cloudflare Workers can be used to implement edge caching, which can significantly improve the performance of your web applications by caching content closer to your users.

Here's a simple example of how you can use a Cloudflare Worker for edge caching:

```javascript
addEventListener('fetch', event => {
  event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request))
})

async function handleRequest(request) {
  const cache = caches.default
  let response = await cache.match(request)

  if (!response) {
    response = await fetch(request)
    event.waitUntil(cache.put(request, response.clone()))
  }

  return response
}
```

In this example, the worker first checks if a cached response is available for the incoming request. If a cached response is not available, it fetches the response from the origin server and caches it before returning the response to the client.

This use case is particularly useful for static content that doesn't change often, as it can significantly reduce the load on your origin server and improve response times for your users.
