# Use Case 17: Using Cloudflare Workers for A/B Testing

Cloudflare Workers can be used to implement A/B testing, which is a method of comparing two versions of a webpage or app against each other to determine which one performs better.

Here is a simple example of how you can use a Cloudflare Worker for A/B testing:

```javascript
addEventListener('fetch', event => {
  event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request))
})

/**
 * Respond with one of two variants, controlled by a cookie
 * @param {Request} request
 */
async function handleRequest(request) {
  // Determine which group this request is in.
  const cookie = request.headers.get('cookie')
  const group = cookie && cookie.includes('__cf_A/B_test_group=blue') ? 'blue' : 'green'

  // Respond with the group's variant.
  if (group === 'blue') {
    return fetch('https://blue.example.com')
  } else {
    return fetch('https://green.example.com')
  }
}
```

In this example, we are using the 'fetch' event listener to handle incoming requests. We then determine the group of the request based on a cookie. If the cookie value is 'blue', we fetch the blue variant of our site. Otherwise, we fetch the green variant. This way, we can easily control the distribution of our A/B testing groups and compare the performance of different versions of our site.
