# Use Case 17: Implementing A/B Testing with Cloudflare Workers 🧪

## Explanation 📚

A/B testing is a method of comparing two versions of a webpage or app against each other to determine which one performs better. With Cloudflare Workers, you can easily implement A/B testing by routing traffic to different versions of your site.

## Example 🧑‍💻

```javascript
addEventListener('fetch', event => {
  event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request))
})

async function handleRequest(request) {
  const NAME = 'experiment-1'

  // The Responses below are placeholders. You can set up your own custom paths
  const TEST_RESPONSE = new Response('Test group') 
  const CONTROL_RESPONSE = new Response('Control group')

  // Determine which group this request is in
  const cookie = request.headers.get('cookie')
  if (cookie && cookie.includes(`${NAME}=control`)) {
    return CONTROL_RESPONSE
  } else if (cookie && cookie.includes(`${NAME}=test`)) {
    return TEST_RESPONSE
  } else {
    // If there's no cookie, this is a new client. Decide which group they're in.
    let group = Math.random() < 0.5 ? 'test' : 'control' // 50/50 split
    let response = group === 'control' ? CONTROL_RESPONSE : TEST_RESPONSE
    response.headers.append('Set-Cookie', `${NAME}=${group}; path=/`)
    return response
  }
}
```

## Pros 👍

1. Cloudflare Workers allow for quick and easy setup of A/B testing.
2. You can control the percentage of users who see each version of your site.
3. Changes can be made and deployed quickly, allowing for rapid iteration and testing.

## Cons 👎

1. A/B testing with Cloudflare Workers requires some knowledge of JavaScript and HTTP headers.
2. If not properly managed, A/B testing can lead to inconsistent user experiences.
