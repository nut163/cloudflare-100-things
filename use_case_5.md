# Use Case 5: Using Cloudflare Workers for A/B Testing

Cloudflare Workers can be used to implement A/B testing, which is a method of comparing two versions of a webpage or app against each other to determine which one performs better.

Here is a simple example of how you can use a Cloudflare Worker for A/B testing:

```javascript
addEventListener('fetch', event => {
  event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request))
})

/**
 * Respond with one of two versions of a site, as part of A/B testing.
 * @param {Request} request
 */
async function handleRequest(request) {
  const NAME = 'experiment-0'

  // The Responses below are placeholders. You can set up your own custom
  // responses in their place.
  let responses = [
    new Response('Response A', {headers: {'Content-Type': 'text/html'}}),
    new Response('Response B', {headers: {'Content-Type': 'text/html'}}),
  ]

  let cookie = request.headers.get('Cookie')

  if (cookie && cookie.includes(`${NAME}=0`)) {
    return responses[0]
  } else if (cookie && cookie.includes(`${NAME}=1`)) {
    return responses[1]
  } else {
    let group = Math.random() < 0.5 ? '0' : '1' // 50/50 split
    let response = responses[group]
    response.headers.append('Set-Cookie', `${NAME}=${group}; path=/`)
    return response
  }
}
```

In this example, we are using the Fetch API's event listener to listen for the 'fetch' event. When the event is triggered, we respond with one of two versions of a site, depending on the value of a cookie. If the cookie doesn't exist, we randomly assign the user to one of the two groups and set a cookie to remember this choice.
