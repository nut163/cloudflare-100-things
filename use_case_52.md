# Use Case 52: Using Cloudflare Workers for A/B Testing

Cloudflare Workers can be used to implement A/B testing, which is a method of comparing two versions of a webpage or app against each other to determine which one performs better.

Here is a simple example of how you can use a Cloudflare Worker for A/B testing:

```javascript
addEventListener('fetch', event => {
  event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request))
})

/**
 * Respond with one of two versions of a webpage
 * @param {Request} request
 */
async function handleRequest(request) {
  const NAME = 'experiment-1'
  // The Responses below are placeholders. You can set up your own custom
  // responses in their place
  const VARIANT_A = new Response('Variant A', {headers: {'content-type': 'text/html'}})
  const VARIANT_B = new Response('Variant B', {headers: {'content-type': 'text/html'}})

  const cookie = request.headers.get('cookie')
  if (cookie && cookie.includes(`${NAME}=control`)) {
    return VARIANT_A
  } else if (cookie && cookie.includes(`${NAME}=test`)) {
    return VARIANT_B
  } else {
    // Determine which group this requester is in.
    const group = Math.random() < 0.5 ? 'control' : 'test'
    const response = group === 'control' ? VARIANT_A : VARIANT_B
    // Set a cookie so that they stay in this group
    response.headers.append('Set-Cookie', `${NAME}=${group}; path=/`)
    return response
  }
}
```

In this example, we are using the Fetch API's event listener to listen for the 'fetch' event. When this event is fired, we respond with one of two versions of a webpage, depending on the value of a cookie. If the cookie does not exist, we randomly assign the requester to one of the two groups and set a cookie to remember this assignment.
