# Use Case 6: Using Cloudflare Workers for A/B Testing

Cloudflare Workers can be used to implement A/B testing, which is a method of comparing two versions of a webpage or app against each other to determine which one performs better.

Here is a simple example of how you can use a Cloudflare Worker for A/B testing:

```javascript
addEventListener('fetch', event => {
  event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request))
})

/**
 * Respond with one of two variants, controlled by a cookie
 * @param {Request} request
 */
async function handleRequest(request) {
  // Determine which group this request is in.
  const cookie = request.headers.get('cookie')
  const group = cookie && cookie.includes('__cf_A/B')
    ? 'B'
    : 'A'
  // Get the appropriate variant
  const url = group === 'A'
    ? 'https://example.com/variantA'
    : 'https://example.com/variantB'
  const response = await fetch(url)
  // Set the cookie in the response
  const newHeaders = new Headers(response.headers)
  newHeaders.append('Set-Cookie', `__cf_A/B=${group}; path=/`)
  return new Response(response.body, {
    status: response.status,
    statusText: response.statusText,
    headers: newHeaders
  })
}
```

In this example, we are checking if the request has a cookie named "__cf_A/B". If it does, we serve the 'B' variant of our site, otherwise we serve the 'A' variant. We then set the cookie in the response so that the client will send it in future requests.
