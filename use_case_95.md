# Use Case 95: Implementing a Custom Load Balancer with Cloudflare Workers

## Explanation

In this use case, we will explore how to implement a custom load balancer using Cloudflare Workers. This can be useful when you want to distribute network or application traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server bears too much demand. 😎

## Example

Here's a simple example of how you can implement this:

```javascript
addEventListener('fetch', event => {
  event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request))
})

const handleRequest = async (request) => {
  const url = new URL(request.url)
  const { pathname } = url

  // Define your server URLs
  const serverUrls = ['https://server1.example.com', 'https://server2.example.com']

  // Get the server index from the pathname
  const serverIndex = parseInt(pathname.substring(1)) % serverUrls.length

  // Fetch from the selected server
  const response = await fetch(serverUrls[serverIndex] + pathname, request)

  return response
}
```

## Pros

1. Cloudflare Workers allow you to implement a custom load balancer without the need for any additional infrastructure. 🚀
2. You can easily scale up or down by simply adding or removing server URLs from your code. 📈

## Cons

1. This approach requires manual management of server URLs in your code. 🤔
2. If a server goes down, the worker will still try to route traffic to it until you update the code. 😓

## Joke

Why don't programmers like nature? It has too many bugs. 🐛😂
