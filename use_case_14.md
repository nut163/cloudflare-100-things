# Use Case 14: Using Cloudflare Workers for A/B Testing

Cloudflare Workers can be used to implement A/B testing, which is a method of comparing two versions of a webpage or app against each other to determine which one performs better.

Here is a simple example of how you can use a Cloudflare Worker for A/B testing:

```javascript
addEventListener('fetch', event => {
  event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request))
})

/**
 * Respond with one of two versions of a site, as part of A/B testing.
 * @param {Request} request
 */
async function handleRequest(request) {
  const NAME = 'experiment-1'

  // The Responses below are placeholders. You can set up your own custom
  // responses in their place.
  const VARIANT_A = new Response('Variant A', {
    headers: { 'content-type': 'text/plain' },
  })
  const VARIANT_B = new Response('Variant B', {
    headers: { 'content-type': 'text/plain' },
  })

  // Determine which group this requester is in.
  const cookie = request.headers.get('cookie')
  if (cookie && cookie.includes(`${NAME}=control`)) {
    return VARIANT_A
  } else if (cookie && cookie.includes(`${NAME}=test`)) {
    return VARIANT_B
  } else {
    // If there is no cookie, this is a new client. Choose a group and set the cookie.
    let group = Math.random() < 0.5 ? 'control' : 'test'
    let response = group === 'control' ? VARIANT_A : VARIANT_B
    response.headers.append('Set-Cookie', `${NAME}=${group}; path=/`)
    return response
  }
}
```

In this example, we are using the `fetch` event listener to handle incoming requests. We define two responses, `VARIANT_A` and `VARIANT_B`, which represent the two versions of the site we are testing. We then check the request's cookies to see if the requester is part of the control group or the test group, and respond with the appropriate version of the site. If the requester is new and does not have a cookie, we randomly assign them to a group and set a cookie to remember their group for future requests.
