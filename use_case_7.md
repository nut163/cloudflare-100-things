# Use Case 7: Using Cloudflare Workers for A/B Testing

Cloudflare Workers can be used to implement A/B testing, which is a method of comparing two versions of a webpage or app against each other to determine which one performs better.

Here's a simple example of how you can use a Cloudflare Worker for A/B testing:

```javascript
addEventListener('fetch', event => {
  event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request))
})

/**
 * Respond with one of two versions of a site, as part of A/B testing
 * @param {Request} request
 */
async function handleRequest(request) {
  const NAME = 'experiment-1'
  // The Responses below can be generated with the HTMLRewriter
  const VARIANT_A = new Response('Variant A response body', {headers: {'content-type': 'text/html'}})
  const VARIANT_B = new Response('Variant B response body', {headers: {'content-type': 'text/html'}})

  // Determine which group this requester is in.
  const cookie = request.headers.get('cookie')
  if (cookie && cookie.includes(`${NAME}=control`)) {
    return VARIANT_A
  } else if (cookie && cookie.includes(`${NAME}=test`)) {
    return VARIANT_B
  } else {
    // If there is no cookie, this is a new client. Decide which variant to serve.
    const group = Math.random() < 0.5 ? 'control' : 'test'
    const response = group === 'control' ? VARIANT_A : VARIANT_B
    // Set a cookie so that they stay in this group.
    response.headers.append('Set-Cookie', `${NAME}=${group}; path=/`)
    return response
  }
}
```

In this example, we're using the Fetch API's event listener to listen for the fetch event. We then determine whether the user should be served the control variant or the test variant, and serve them that variant along with a Set-Cookie header to ensure they continue to see the same variant.
