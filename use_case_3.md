# Use Case 3: Using Cloudflare Workers for A/B Testing

Cloudflare Workers can be used to implement A/B testing, which is a method of comparing two versions of a webpage or app against each other to determine which one performs better.

Here's a simple example of how you can use a Cloudflare Worker for A/B testing:

```javascript
addEventListener('fetch', event => {
  event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request))
})

/**
 * Respond with one of two versions of a site, as part of A/B testing.
 * @param {Request} request
 */
async function handleRequest(request) {
  const NAME = 'experiment-0'

  // The Responses below are placeholders. You can set up your own
  // Responses, or fetch them from a remote server
  const VARIANT_A = new Response('Variant A', {
    headers: { 'content-type': 'text/plain' },
  })
  const VARIANT_B = new Response('Variant B', {
    headers: { 'content-type': 'text/plain' },
  })

  // Determine which group this requester is in
  const cookie = request.headers.get('cookie')
  if (cookie && cookie.includes(`${NAME}=control`)) {
    return VARIANT_A
  } else if (cookie && cookie.includes(`${NAME}=test`)) {
    return VARIANT_B
  } else {
    // If there is no cookie, this is a new client. Choose a group and set the cookie.
    let group = Math.random() < 0.5 ? 'control' : 'test'
    let response = group === 'control' ? VARIANT_A : VARIANT_B
    response.headers.append('Set-Cookie', `${NAME}=${group}; path=/`)
    return response
  }
}
```

In this example, we're using a cookie to track whether a user is part of the control group or the test group. Depending on the group, we serve them a different version of the site. If the user doesn't have a cookie yet, we randomly assign them to a group and set the cookie accordingly.
