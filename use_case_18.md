# Use Case 18: Using Cloudflare Workers for A/B Testing

Cloudflare Workers can be used to implement A/B testing, which is a method of comparing two versions of a webpage or app against each other to determine which one performs better.

Here is a simple example of how you can use a Cloudflare Worker for A/B testing:

```javascript
addEventListener('fetch', event => {
  event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request))
})

/**
 * Respond with one of two versions of a site, as part of A/B testing.
 * @param {Request} request
 */
async function handleRequest(request) {
  const NAME = 'experiment-1'

  // The Responses below are placeholders. You can set up your own
  // responses, or fetch them from a remote server
  const TEST_RESPONSE = new Response('Response 1', {
    headers: { 'content-type': 'text/plain' },
  })

  const CONTROL_RESPONSE = new Response('Response 2', {
    headers: { 'content-type': 'text/plain' },
  })

  // Determine which group this request is in
  const cookie = request.headers.get('cookie')
  if (cookie && cookie.includes(`${NAME}=control`)) {
    return CONTROL_RESPONSE
  } else if (cookie && cookie.includes(`${NAME}=test`)) {
    return TEST_RESPONSE
  } else {
    // If there is no cookie, this is a new client. Decide which group they should be in
    const group = Math.random() < 0.5 ? 'test' : 'control' // 50/50 split
    const response = group === 'control' ? CONTROL_RESPONSE : TEST_RESPONSE
    // Set a new cookie with the group assignment
    response.headers.append('Set-Cookie', `${NAME}=${group}; path=/`)
    return response
  }
}
```

In this example, we are using the Fetch API to listen for a fetch event. When the event is triggered, we check if the request has a cookie that indicates whether it belongs to the control group or the test group. If the cookie exists, we return the corresponding response. If the cookie does not exist, this means the client is new, so we randomly assign them to a group and set a cookie to remember this assignment.
