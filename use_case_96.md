# Use Case 96: Implementing a Custom Load Balancer with Cloudflare Workers

In this use case, we will explore how to implement a custom load balancer using Cloudflare Workers. This can be useful when you want to distribute network or application traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server bears too much demand. 😎

## Example

Here's a simple example of how you can implement this:

```javascript
addEventListener('fetch', event => {
  event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request))
})

const handleRequest = async (request) => {
  const url = new URL(request.url)
  const { pathname } = url

  // Define your server URLs
  const serverUrls = ['https://server1.example.com', 'https://server2.example.com']

  // Get the server index from the pathname
  const serverIndex = parseInt(pathname.substring(1)) % serverUrls.length

  // Fetch from the selected server
  const response = await fetch(serverUrls[serverIndex] + pathname, request)

  return response
}
```

This script listens for fetch events, and for each request, it selects a server from the `serverUrls` array based on the pathname of the request. It then fetches the request from the selected server and returns the response.

## Pros

1. Flexibility: You can implement your own load balancing algorithm based on your specific needs. 🎯
2. Scalability: It allows you to easily scale your application by distributing the load across multiple servers. 📈
3. Resilience: If one server goes down, the load balancer can redirect traffic to the remaining servers. 🛡️

## Cons

1. Complexity: Implementing a custom load balancer can add complexity to your application. 🤔
2. Maintenance: You need to maintain the list of server URLs and update it whenever a server is added or removed. 🛠️

And now for a little joke to lighten the mood: Why don't programmers like nature? It has too many bugs! 🐞😂
