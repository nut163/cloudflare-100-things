# Use Case 47: Using Cloudflare Workers for A/B Testing

Cloudflare Workers can be used to implement A/B testing, which is a method of comparing two versions of a webpage or app against each other to determine which one performs better.

Here is a simple example of how you can use a Cloudflare Worker for A/B testing:

```javascript
addEventListener('fetch', event => {
  event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request))
})

/**
 * Respond with one of two variants, controlled by a cookie
 * @param {Request} request
 */
async function handleRequest(request) {
  // Determine which group this request is in.
  const cookie = request.headers.get('cookie')
  const group = cookie && cookie.includes('__cf_A/B_test_cookie=blue') ? 'blue' : 'green'

  // Respond with the group's corresponding variant.
  return fetch(group === 'blue' ? 'https://blue.example.com' : 'https://green.example.com')
}
```

In this example, we are using a cookie to determine which group the user belongs to. If the user has a cookie named "__cf_A/B_test_cookie" with the value "blue", they will be served the 'blue' variant of the site. Otherwise, they will be served the 'green' variant.

This is a simple example, but Cloudflare Workers can be used to implement more complex A/B testing scenarios.
