# Use Case 100: Implementing a Custom Load Balancer with Cloudflare Workers üéØ

## Explanation üìö

In this use case, we will explore how to implement a custom load balancer using Cloudflare Workers. Load balancing is a critical aspect of any large-scale application, and with Cloudflare Workers, we can customize the load balancing logic to suit our specific needs.

## Example üß™

```javascript
addEventListener('fetch', event => {
  event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request))
})

const BACKENDS = [
  'https://backend1.example.com',
  'https://backend2.example.com',
  'https://backend3.example.com',
]

async function handleRequest(request) {
  const backendUrl = BACKENDS[Math.floor(Math.random() * BACKENDS.length)]
  const newRequest = new Request(backendUrl + request.url, request)
  return fetch(newRequest)
}
```

In this example, we randomly select a backend from a list of backends for each incoming request. This is a simple round-robin load balancing strategy.

## Pros and Cons üèÅ

### Pros:

1. **Flexibility**: With Cloudflare Workers, you can implement any load balancing strategy you want, not just round-robin or least connections.
2. **Performance**: Cloudflare Workers run at the edge, closer to your users, which can improve the performance of your load balancer.

### Cons:

1. **Complexity**: Implementing a custom load balancer can be more complex than using a pre-built solution.
2. **Cost**: Depending on the number of requests, the cost of running a Cloudflare Worker for load balancing could be higher than other solutions.

## Joke of the Day üòÇ

Why don't programmers like nature? It has too many bugs! üêõ
