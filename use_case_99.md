# Use Case 99: Using Cloudflare Workers for A/B Testing

Cloudflare Workers can be used to implement A/B testing, which is a method of comparing two versions of a webpage or app against each other to determine which one performs better.

Here's an example of how you can use a Cloudflare Worker for A/B testing:

```javascript
addEventListener('fetch', event => {
  event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request))
})

/**
 * Respond with one of two variants, as determined by a cookie
 * @param {Request} request
 */
async function handleRequest(request) {
  // Determine which group this request is in.
  const cookie = request.headers.get('cookie')
  const group = cookie && cookie.includes('__cf_A/B')
    ? 'B'
    : 'A'
  // Get the appropriate variant
  const url = group === 'B'
    ? 'https://example.com/variant-B'
    : 'https://example.com/variant-A'
  const response = await fetch(url)
  // Set the cookie in the response
  const newHeaders = new Headers(response.headers)
  newHeaders.append('Set-Cookie', `__cf_A/B=${group}; path=/`)
  return new Response(response.body, {
    status: response.status,
    statusText: response.statusText,
    headers: newHeaders
  })
}
```

In this example, we're using a cookie to determine which variant to serve to a user. If the cookie `__cf_A/B` is present and its value is 'B', we serve the 'B' variant. Otherwise, we serve the 'A' variant. We then set the cookie in the response so that the user will continue to see the same variant.
