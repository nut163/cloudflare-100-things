The shared dependencies between the files we are generating are:

1. **Markdown Syntax**: All files are markdown (.md) files, so they share the common syntax of markdown for formatting text.

2. **File Naming Convention**: All files follow a similar naming convention, i.e., "use_case_n.md", where n is the number of the use case.

3. **Cloudflare Workers Examples**: Each file contains an example of how Cloudflare workers can be utilized, so they share the common theme of Cloudflare workers' use cases.

4. **README Navigation**: The README.md file in the root directory will contain links to all other markdown files. Therefore, the naming of the markdown files and their corresponding links in the README are shared dependencies.

5. **GitHub Repository**: All files are part of the same GitHub repository, so they share the repository's properties and settings.

Note: As these are markdown files and not code files, there are no shared exported variables, data schemas, id names of DOM elements, message names, or function names.
